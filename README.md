## Installation

## Contribution

Feel free to fork / PR this repo to contribut, I actively review PR.

Feel free to open issue / start conversation, especially if you have idea to increase calcul accuracy.

UX is still lacking, and the guesstimation of CO2 emission can be improve :

- Different estimation based on type of ressource consumed
- Different estimation based on country energy mix (I used .99 Pound per kWH as it is the official number for US)
- Estimation of dom rendering time / css cascading and their consumption
- Bugfixes
- More crazy ideas

Another cool functionality to add could be a journalized log to track evolution of your consumption / consumption on various website over day / month / years
